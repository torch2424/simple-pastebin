It's literally just a <textarea>, that saves to localStorage. Paste stuff, and it automatically saves as you paste/type!

## Motivation

Because I wanted it, and I can build stuff way past my bedtime. Thank you very mcuh. 😂

## Contributing

There is no build system, this is as vanilla JS as it gets! 🍦

But, we do have some convience npm scripts for making releases:

`npm run deploy` - To run np and simply do a github release.
`npm run zip` - To make a zip file for the chrome web store.

However, Images in `assets/walks` are random images I found on the internet for something cool / fun. They are not owned by me, and simply were added to add some fun to a Free and Open Source Chrome Extension. :)
